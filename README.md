To run the Discord bot code you provided, follow these steps:

## 1. Set Up a Discord Bot:
- Create a Discord Developer Account:
  - Go to the Discord Developer Portal.
  - Log in with your Discord account.
- Create a New Application:
  - Click on "New Application".
  - Enter a name for your bot and click "Create".
- Create a Bot:
  - In the left sidebar, go to "Bot".
  - Click "Add Bot" and confirm.
  - You’ll see the bot’s token under the "TOKEN" section. Keep this token safe and secure, as it is needed to run your bot.
- Invite the Bot to Your Server:
  - In the left sidebar, go to "OAuth2" > "URL Generator".
  - Under "SCOPES", select "bot".
  - Under "BOT PERMISSIONS", select the necessary permissions (e.g., "Send Messages", "Read Messages", "Manage Messages", etc.).
  - Copy the generated URL, paste it into your browser, and invite the bot to your server.
## 2. Set Up Your Development Environment:
- Install Python:
  - Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
- Install the Discord Library:
  - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.) and install the discord.py library using pip:
  - pip install discord.py
## 3. Create and Run the Bot Script:
- Create a Python File:
- Open a text editor or IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).
- Create a new file with a .py extension (e.g., discord_bot.py).
- Copy and paste the bot code you provided into the file.
- Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with the actual bot token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.
- Run the Script: python discord_bot.py
